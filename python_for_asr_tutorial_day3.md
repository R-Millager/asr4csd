# **Day 3: Learning Basic Python for Whisper/Pyannote**

> **Why this is important:** Understanding basic Python operations will help you troubleshoot errors, modify transcription settings, and process data more effectively.

## **1. Key Python Skills to Learn**

- Running Python scripts: `python script.py`
- Using `pandas` for data handling (`pip install pandas`)
- Working with lists and dictionaries (for storing results)
- File paths and working directories in Python

## **2. Practice Using Python for Data Handling**

Try running the following script in **Anaconda Prompt** or a **Jupyter Notebook**:
**NOTE TO SELF: IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO USE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, MIGHT AS WELL DO IT HERE TOO. MAKE NECESSARY CHANGES BELOW.**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Speaker': ['Speaker 1', 'Speaker 2'], 'Text': ['Hello!', 'How are you?']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

This will display a simple **table structure** like a CSV output.

> ðŸ”¹ **Recommended Practice:** Use Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook`) for experimenting.
