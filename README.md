# Step-by-Step Guide: Running Whisper and Pyannote on Windows for Speech-Language Transcription, v. 1.0

## *By Ryan A. Millager, MS CCC-SLP, Vanderbilt University*

## **Overview**

This guide will help you set up and run **Whisper** (for transcription) and **Pyannote** (for speaker diarization) on your Windows 11 device. Since these tools rely on Python and machine learning models, the main focus of this tutorial is to establish the necessary environment configured. Opportunities for additional learning and data science literacy are noted. We will use Anaconda as a user-friendly platform for running Python; although Anaconda is not strictly required for running Python on a PC, we recommend it for beginners. This tutorial was conceived as a day-by-day learning process, with manageable goals for each day's topic, however it is a self-guided tutorial that can be taken at the reader's preferred pace.

*Note: this tutorial reflects my goals to use transcription/diarization tools for research in communication sciences and disorders, with open-source and HIPAA-compliant pipelines.*

### **Prerequisites for This Tutorial**

- Windows 11 PC (**TO ADD: MEMORY/PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR PIPELINE**)
- Administrative permissions (and willingness) to install additional tools like Python and Jupyter Notebook
- A test audio file (.wav format) -- we recommend a recording of just a few minutes (3-5 minutes max) with two speakers and minimal background noise so that you can test the tools in this tutorial.
