# **Day 7: Speech-Language Analysis and Accuracy Measures**

# **NOTE THAT THIS PAGE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

> **Why this is important:** Now that you have a pipeline that successfully estimates timestamped utterances from an audio file, there are two follow-up steps that we need to be able to use these transcripts for speech-language analysis:
- 1. [Tools to convert the ASR transcript](#1-converting-asr-transcripts-for-analysis) to formats for common speech-language analysis
- 2. [Methods to evaluate the accuracy and performance](#2-evaluating-accuracy-and-performance) of your ASR product.

## **1. Converting ASR transcripts for analysis**

Speech-language researchers and clinicians use a wide range of tools to code and annotate transcripts for analyis. Although this is not an exhaustive list, we provide methods to convert the ASR output from this pipeline to formats used by three powerful and widely used platforms.

*At present, all conversion code is in R. Teaching R is beyond the scope of this tutorial -- in the future, we hope to have more user-friendly applications for these conversion tools.

### **SALT**

>SALT is XXX (about SALT, link to website).

SALT is, in many ways, the most straightforward... brief words about what the SALT transcript looks like and what the final format should be. Ignores timestamps.

### **CLAN**

CLAN has a specific format to follow as well... describe .cha file.
